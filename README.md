# RBAC
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) authentication ensures secure access by assigning permissions based on user roles, such as admin, editor, or viewer. The system includes a login feature for verifying user credentials and providing role-specific access, and a register functionality for new users to sign up and define their roles.
